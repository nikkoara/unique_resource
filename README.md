This source code is based on the work and code of [Peter
Sommerlad](http://tinyurl.com/hpzgalw), Andrew Sandoval, Eric Niebler, and
Daniel Kr√ºgler. It contains minor additions and changes, as well as a skeleton
of unit testing that I needed to get confidence in its functionality. The unit
testing in particular is borrowing from unique_ptr unit tests.
